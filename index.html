        Hello World! I am Bryan Denq, a current junior in the University of Pennsylvania studying Psychology
        with a minor in Consumer Psychology. My hobbies and interests include
        <ul>
            <li>
                Screeching with my friends as we play video or board games
            </li>
            <li>
                Playing Volleyball and getting caught up its adrenaline-filled atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooking food by following recipies or improvising new ones
                (an avocado in one hand and baked potatoes with salt on the other and taking alternating bites is surprisingly delicious!)
            </li>
            <li>
                Shaking my head as I rolled four natural 1's in a Dungeons and Dragon campaign
            </li>
        </ul>
